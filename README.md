# intro
This project involves developing a ChatGPT-powered conversational chatbot designed to replace traditional inquiry and consultation services provided by study abroad agencies. The chatbot aims to simulate the experience of interacting with a customer service representative by answering questions related to the agency's services and study abroad opportunities. Additionally, the chatbot will be capable of collecting personal information from users, which can be used to tailor responses and provide more personalized assistance.

# goal
The primary goals of this chatbot are to streamline the consultation process, provide instant and accurate information, and efficiently gather the necessary details from prospective students to assist them better.
